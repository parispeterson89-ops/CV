From CNC Machining Operator to Full Stack Developer
I began my career in the industrial sector, gaining practical experience in CNC machining, where I operated machines such as Heller, Mazak and Brother in the production of parts for large automakers (Scania, Mercedes, Volkswagen, MAN). During almost four years at Tupy S.A, I developed skills in part measurement, quality control and production monitoring, including 3D control.

Even though I worked in the industrial sector, I was always interested in technology and software development. In parallel with my work, I began studying in the areas of IT, logistics and mechatronics, which expanded my technical knowledge and awakened my passion for programming.

With a mindset focused on innovation and continuous learning, I decided to migrate to Full Stack Development. To this end, I enrolled in specialized courses, such as the Full Stack Development program (Python) at EBAC and (JavaScript) at Mate Academy, where I have been improving my skills..., in addition to delving deeper into Data Structures, APIs, Databases, Machine Learning and Cybersecurity.

Currently, I am focused on developing robust and scalable solutions, applying my acquired knowledge to create efficient applications in both the Front-End and Back-End, and also focusing on learning from new experiences in the area... I am looking for opportunities to consolidate this transition and contribute to the success of innovative technological projects.
